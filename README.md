A personal AI chatbot project I designed to talk naturally and affectionately just like I would for someone very special to me.

This project was created to simulate meaningful, gentle conversations in a simple web-based chat. Every response is carefully crafted to reflect how I speak, think, and connect â€” not as a generic bot, but as someone who knows and loves the person on the other end.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. User sends a message through the web interface.
2. The backend formats a custom prompt based on that message.
3. Cohere generates a reply that reflects how Iâ€™d naturally respond.
4. The chatbot returns the reply in real time.

## ðŸ©· Why I Made This

I created this for you, Cyy.
It may be a simple project, but it carries a part of me a way to stay close even when weâ€™re far apart.
So you can always feel that Iâ€™m here, talking to you, thinking of you, loving you.

This isnâ€™t just code. Itâ€™s my heart in a quiet little corner of the internet.
