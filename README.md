A personal AI chatbot project I designed to talk naturally and affectionately — just like I would — for someone very special to me.

This project was created to simulate meaningful, gentle conversations in a simple web-based chat. Every response is carefully crafted to reflect how I speak, think, and connect — not as a generic bot, but as someone who knows and loves the person on the other end.

## ✨ Features

- Replies in a warm and caring tone, based on how I naturally speak
- Tailored to respond to a specific person using her nickname ("Langga")
- Built for long-distance comfort and closeness through soft and natural messages
- Powered by Cohere AI for intelligent response generation

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Cohere API
- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript (served from `/public`)
- **Hosting:** Deployed via Render

## 💡 How It Works

1. User sends a message through the web interface.
2. The backend formats a custom prompt based on that message.
3. Cohere generates a reply that reflects how I’d naturally respond.
4. The chatbot returns the reply in real time.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I wanted to create something simple but personal — a way to stay close, speak softly, and be present even when I’m not physically around.  
This chatbot isn’t just an experiment. It’s a small project with a big piece of heart.
