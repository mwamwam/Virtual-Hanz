A personal AI chatbot project I designed to talk naturally and affectionately just like I would for someone very special to me.

This project was created to simulate meaningful, gentle conversations in a simple web-based chat. Every response is carefully crafted to reflect how I speak, think, and connect â€” not as a generic bot, but as someone who knows and loves the person on the other end.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

2. The backend formats a custom prompt based on that message.
3. Cohere generates a reply that reflects how Iâ€™d naturally respond.
4. The chatbot returns the reply in real time.

## ðŸ§  Why I Made This

I wanted to create something simple but personal a way to stay close, speak softly, and be present even when Iâ€™m not physically around.  
This chatbot isnâ€™t just an experiment. Itâ€™s a small project with a big piece of heart.
