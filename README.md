A personal AI chatbot project I designed to talk naturally and affectionately just like I would for someone very special to me.

This project was created to simulate meaningful, gentle conversations in a simple web-based chat. Every response is carefully crafted to reflect how I speak, think, and connect — not as a generic bot, but as someone who knows and loves the person on the other end.

## 💡 How It Works

1. User sends a message through the web interface.
2. The backend formats a custom prompt based on that message.
3. Cohere generates a reply that reflects how I’d naturally respond.
4. The chatbot returns the reply in real time.

## 🩷 Why I Made This

This was made for someone special someone who means more than words can say.
It’s a quiet way to stay close, to be present in small ways, even from far away.
What started as a simple project became something personal — filled with care, memories, and love.

Not just a chatbot. A piece of heart, made for her.
